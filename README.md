# Khmer-Sentiment-Analysis

> Sentiment Analysis for Khmer Language using Machine Learning (k-NN).  
> Forked and modified from an open-source English NLP project to support Khmer text data.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a sentiment analysis model for Khmer-language sentences using basic machine learning techniques. The original repository focused on English sentiment classification â€” this version adapts it by:

- Replacing the dataset with Khmer-labeled sentences.
- Applying Khmer-specific text preprocessing (stopword removal, tokenization).
- Training a k-NN model using `scikit-learn`.
- Visualizing performance metrics such as accuracy and classification report.

## Course Info

This project is part of a final assignment for the _Open Source Software_ course, modified and presented by a solo student.
